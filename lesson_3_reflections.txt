When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
so that you can share your work; view and edit it from another machine; back it up

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If other people are making changes to your code you would DEFINITELY want to pick and choose what changes to make to your local version.
