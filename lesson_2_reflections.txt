What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git starts to track the files in the directory in which the git repository was initialized. 
a git file doesn't automatically exist in a directory, it must be created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
working directory has the files in their current state or whatever state they were in, if you choose to checkout a 
previous commit. The staging area is used to hold files on which you want to make a commit. 
You may want to make changes to some files (if you previously created a bug), but not others (if you created valuable changes).
