How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Narrowed down the possible places where the bug could have been introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
make it east to find the point before a bug was introduced or subsequently unwanted change was made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: logical commits, anotated, will probably be easier for user to remember as they made commits and anotated them.
cons: time consuming, user may forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
As a programmer you are regularly working with multiple files that effect each other. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the different commits and git diff allows you to view the insertions and deleations between two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You know you can easily get back to a place before the changes were made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My next project!
